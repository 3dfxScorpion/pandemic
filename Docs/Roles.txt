Contingency Planner

The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from anywhere 
in the Player Discard Pile and set it aside. Only 1 Event card can be set aside 
at a time. It does not count against his hand limit.

When the Contingency Planner plays his set-aside Event card, remove the Event 
card from the game (instead of discarding it).

********************************************************************************
Dispatcher

The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
- move any pawn to any city containing another pawn, or
- move another player's pawn as if it were his own.
When moving a player's pawn as if it were his own, the Dispatcher discards cards
for Direct and Charter Flights from his own hand. A card discarded for a Charter 
Flight must match the city the pawn is moving from.

The Dispatcher can only move other player's pawns; he may not direct them to do 
other actions, such as Treat Disease.

********************************************************************************
Medic

The Medic removes all cubes, not 1, of the same color when doing the Treat 
Disease action.

If a disease has been cured, he automatically removes all cubes of that color 
from a city, simply by entering it or being there. This does not take an action.

The Medic's automatic removal of cubes can occur on other player's turns, if he 
is moved by the Dispatcher or the Airlift Event.

The Medic also prevents placing disease cubes (and outbreaks) of cured diseases 
in his location.

********************************************************************************
Operations Expert

The Operations Expert may, as an action, either:
- build a research station in his current city without discarding a card, or
- once per turn, move from a research station to any city by discarding any 
  City card.

The Dispatcher may not use the Operations Expert's special move ability when 
moving the Operations Expert's pawn.

********************************************************************************
Quarantine Specialist

The Quarantine Specialist prevents both outbreaks and the placement of disease 
cubes in the city she is in and all cities connected to that city.

********************************************************************************
Researcher

The Researcher may give any City card from her hand to another player in the 
same city as her, without this card having to match her city. The transfer must 
be from her hand to the other player's hand, but it can occur on either player's 
turn.

********************************************************************************
Scientist

The Scientist needs only 4 (not 5) City cards of the same disease color to
Discover a Cure for that disease.
