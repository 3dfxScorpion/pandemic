file(s):  ALL OF THEM

COMPILING FROM THE COMMAND LINE:

Compiles under Visual Studio's Developer's Command Prompt
Go to the working directory and run: cl /EHsc mainGame.cpp

I tried to create a Visual Studio Project out of these files, but
generated numerous errors/warnings.  So, will leave it as a working
directory that can be compiled from there.

This release candidate provides a visual of some infected cities,
two player's hands, and a sample menu list.
