file(s):  ALL OF THEM

COMPILING FROM THE COMMAND LINE:

Compiles under Visual Studio's Developer's Command Prompt
Go to the working directory and run: cl /EHsc mainGame.cpp

I tried to create a Visual Studio Project out of these files, but
generated numerous errors/warnings.  So, will leave it as a working
directory that can be compiled from there.

This release candidate provides a visual of some infected cities,
two player's hands, and a sample menu list.

ISSUES:
Currently, only option 2 "Direct Flight" does... more than nothing.  :)

TODO:
- Expand methods out to appropriate classes (MVC Design)
- Provide an easier means to move to city with simplified City constructor
- provide more game details and parameters (see Issues under GitHub)
