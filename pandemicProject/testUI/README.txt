file(s):  ALL OF THEM

COMPILING FROM THE COMMAND LINE:
Because this uses an "unordered_set" for the random deck id's, you will need to include
the "-std=gnu++11" argument to your command line.

Example:  g++ -std=gnu++11 buildDeck.cpp

The purpose of this submission is to provide one scenario (to be determined) for submission
